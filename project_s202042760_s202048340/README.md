ICS 474 Project
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and modeling pipeline focused on classification and regression tasks using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze trip data, perform feature engineering, and evaluate model performance across various features.

Project Structure

Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
Splits the data into training and test sets.
Modeling:

Classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict the trip category (Personal vs. Business).
Regression model (Linear Regression) to predict mileage based on trip details.
Evaluation:

Plots and evaluates model performance, including feature importance and accuracy metrics.
Visualizations:

Generates bar charts, scatter plots, and other visuals to illustrate trip category distributions, feature importance, and prediction comparisons.


Requirements
Python 3.x
Required packages:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Usage


To run this project:

Install the required libraries.
Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially.
Review the output for insights into the trip data and model performance.
Project Notes
Ensure data integrity by following the preprocessing steps.
Modify the paths or data as needed to align with your dataset.
Visualizations include titles, axis labels, and legends for clear interpretation.
