# Uber Dataset Analysis

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze Uber trip data to understand trip purposes, distances, start and end locations, and the categories of the trips. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights that can be used for further business or personal applications.

## Main Code Files and Their Purpose
- **ICS474-Project.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains all the code necessary to perform the analysis on the Uber dataset. It includes data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization steps.

## Instructions for Running the Code
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - The following Python libraries:
     - pandas
     - numpy
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn
     - scikit-learn
2. **Setup**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
   - Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already by running:
     ```sh
     pip install notebook
     ```
   - Install the required libraries by running:
     ```sh
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Clone this repository or download the `ICS474-Project.ipynb` file to your local machine.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the notebook file in your terminal.
   - Start Jupyter Notebook by running:
     ```sh
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - In the Jupyter interface, open the `ICS474-Project.ipynb` file.
   - Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and generate the analysis.
