Project objectives:
Develop Expertise in Big Data Analytics: Gain hands-on experience in working with large datasets, applying data processing, preprocessing, and modeling techniques.

Analyze a Specific Dataset: Explore, preprocess, and analyze the selected dataset to extract meaningful insights, focusing on understanding the dataset's context and features.

Build Predictive Models: Use machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models that solve a real-world problem related to the dataset (e.g., fraud detection, prediction tasks).

Evaluate and Visualize Results: Implement robust evaluation metrics to assess model performance and use visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

Promote Collaborative Work: Collaborate as a team to approach the problem comprehensively and share responsibilities across different aspects of the project.


Main code files and their purpose:
all codes are in the folder and each got it is purpose and use as a comment so that it is clear for the reader


Instructions for running the code:
make sure to use vscode (do not run it on juypter or any online ide)
make sure to install all libaires needed (using pip install)
make sure to download the dataset (csv file) and put the path of it in the code (each person will have diffrent path)
run each code for each question one by one and seperatly (do not run all of them once and do not mix two question codes at once)
if you face any problem (all codes with outputs are shown in the report file, use the word file for better quality for the photos)
