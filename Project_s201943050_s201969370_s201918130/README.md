# Uber Trip Distance Prediction - ICS 474 Project  

This project uses machine learning models to predict trip distances (`MILES`) based on features such as trip start and stop locations, category, and purpose. The Gradient Boosting Regressor was selected for its high performance in handling complex relationships within the dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training and evaluation.

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes an Uber dataset to predict trip distances using various features. Key steps include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection. The final Gradient Boosting Regressor model achieved an RÂ² score of 0.94, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.
